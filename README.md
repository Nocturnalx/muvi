This is an audio visualizer project primarily targeting the raspberry pi but also for desktop linux as well.

It uses gtk 3 for the window, expoy for openGL rendering and the pulse audio api to capture audio so to build you need:
`sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libepoxy-dev libpulse-dev`

the binary in /bin is only for raspberry pi.
